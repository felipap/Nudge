## About

AI that lives on your computer and complains when you're procrastinating. Nudge watches your computer screen to help you stay in flow. Feed it an activity ("I want to vibe code for an hour"), and Nudge will alert when it looks like you're doing something else.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

Nudge captures your screen on a schedule and asks AI (today GPT-4o) if you are doing the activity you set for yourself.

### Does Nudge track my computer data?

No. Nudge sends your screen captures directly to OpenAI and does not export any data. (There are no servers today.)

### Can I use a different model instead?

I will ship this if people ask for it.

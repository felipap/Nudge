## About

Nudge lives on your computer and helps you stay in flow. Give it an activity you want to do and a duration, and Nudge will alert you when it looks like you are doing something else.

Nudge **requires an OpenAI service account** to use today. I will ship support for Gemini and Claude depending on demand. ([File an issue.](https://github.com/felipap/nudge/issues))
